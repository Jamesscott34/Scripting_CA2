## Sample Security Reports

This directory is intended to hold **example output** from the Task 2 scripts:

- `sast_bandit.py` – JSON and text reports from Bandit.
- `dast_zap.py` – Exported alerts from OWASP ZAP.
- `fuzz_test.py` – Any logs or findings from fuzzing runs.

You can commit anonymised or trimmed reports here to demonstrate that you ran
the tools as part of your CA2 submission.
