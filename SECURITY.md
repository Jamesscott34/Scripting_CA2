## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue with exploit details.
2. Instead, please contact the maintainer privately via the email address
   listed on the GitHub profile for this repository, or open a GitHub issue
   marked clearly as *Security* with only high-level, non-exploit details and
   ask for a private communication channel.
3. Include:
   - A clear description of the issue and potential impact.
   - Steps (or a proof-of-concept) to reproduce the problem.
   - Any relevant logs, stack traces, or configuration details.

You can normally expect:

- **Initial acknowledgement** of your report within **5 working days**.
- **Status updates** at least every **two weeks** while the issue is being
  investigated and fixed.
- A coordinated disclosure where, if applicable, a fix is prepared and released
  before full technical details are made public.
