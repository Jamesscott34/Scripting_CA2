# CI workflow for the CA2 Secure Programming & Scripting project.
# It runs tests and security tooling in both secure and insecure modes,
# and then repeats key tests inside the Docker environment.

on:
  # Run on every push to main and on pull requests targeting main.
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

    steps:
      # 1) Get the source code.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2) Prepare Python runtime.
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"

      # 3) Install top-level dependencies (including security tooling deps).
      - name: Install root requirements.txt
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # 4) Install Django application requirements and Bandit.
      - name: Install Django app requirements
        run: |
          pip install -r ca2_secure_website/requirements.txt
          pip install bandit

      # 5) Run Django tests against a fresh SQLite database in SECURE mode.
      #    SECURE_MODE=secure enables all protections; TEST_MODE=secure ensures
      #    Task 2 integration tests only exercise the secure path.
      - name: Run Django tests (secure mode, SQLite)
        working-directory: ca2_secure_website
        env:
          SECURE_MODE: secure
          USE_SQLITE: 1
        run: |
          python manage.py makemigrations app
          python manage.py migrate
          TEST_MODE=secure python manage.py test

      # 6) Run Django tests again but in INSECURE mode.
      #    SECURE_MODE=insecure switches to the intentionally vulnerable paths
      #    (raw SQL, XSS-friendly output, CSRF disabled) so tests and scripts
      #    can demonstrate real issues.
      - name: Run Django tests (insecure mode, SQLite)
        working-directory: ca2_secure_website
        env:
          SECURE_MODE: insecure
          USE_SQLITE: 1
        run: |
          TEST_MODE=insecure python manage.py test

      # 7) Run Bandit SAST against the Django project.
      #    This is mode-agnostic: it always scans the same codebase.
      - name: Run Bandit SAST
        run: |
          bandit -r ca2_secure_website -q

      # 8) Build and start the Docker Compose stack (web + db).
      #    This ensures the Dockerised app can be built and run successfully.
      - name: Build and start Docker Compose
        working-directory: docker
        run: |
          docker --version
          docker compose version
          docker compose up -d --build

      # 9) Run Django tests *inside* the Docker web container in both modes.
      #    SECURE_MODE environment variable is passed through to run tests
      #    first in secure, then in insecure mode.
      - name: Run Django tests inside Docker (secure and insecure)
        working-directory: docker
        env:
          PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1"
        run: |
          docker compose run --rm -e SECURE_MODE=secure web python manage.py test
          docker compose run --rm -e SECURE_MODE=insecure web python manage.py test

      # 10) Always stop containers and remove volumes to keep CI clean.
      - name: Stop Docker Compose and clean volumes
        if: always()
        working-directory: docker
        run: |
          docker compose down -v
