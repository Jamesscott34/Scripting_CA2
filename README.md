## Secure Programming & Scripting – CA2 Project

This repository contains the **CA2 Secure Programming & Scripting** project.
It is organised into three main components:

- **Task 1 – Secure Django Website** (`ca2_secure_website/`)
- **Task 2 – Security Scripts** (`task2_scripts/`)
- **Task 3 – DevOps, CI/CD, Docker & Security Documentation** (`docker/`, `CA2.yaml`, `setup.sh`)

The goal is to showcase a **modern banking-style web application** with a
**Secure / Insecure mode toggle**, plus supporting security tooling and automation.

See the individual `README.md` files and `CA2.yaml` for more detailed guidance.
