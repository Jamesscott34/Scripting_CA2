## CA2 Secure Django Banking Website

This Django project implements a **banking-style web application** with:

- User registration and login
- Dashboard and profile views
- Simple account/search views
- A **Secure / Insecure mode toggle** controlled via environment variables

The code is structured for teaching **secure coding practices**, showing how
settings and views change under different security modes.
